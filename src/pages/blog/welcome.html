<h1>This is my first post</h1>
<p>
    In this blog i'm going to write about my progress with this learning experience
</p>
<h2>Some of the thing i'm going to do</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Implement a responsive layout with css grid. Navbar, Footer, Sidebar, you name it</li>
    <li>tailwind.css theme with css variables, dark mode, typography defaults</li>
    <li>markdown support for easier blog writing. Support images, code highlighing, metadata</li>
    <li>use routify features like next,prev</li>
    <li>a rock solid build (maybe snowpack2 ?), export with full support for far future caching</li>
    <li>serviceworker with workbox, potentially with some clever differential html loading</li>
    <li>... a lot more</li>
</ul>
